# 1.Academic Open System, AOS.org.

## Our mission

The mission of AOS is to provide an open-access, free-access, computer-based knowledge review-based electronic journal academic exchange community for teachers and students, from existing materials, literature, and all types of knowledge stored in computers and computer networks. Build a network of knowledge points to promote the development, education and adoption of the "science" of all kinds of academic knowledge and skills, specifically promoting each person's zone of proximal development in technology, especially computing and data processing.

## our agency

The organization of AOS consists of journal editorial board, programming development community, and computer operation. The programming development community is built on the github organization https://github.com/AcademicOpenSystem. Computer operation refers to the hands-on ability of discussion, design, drawing, programming, manufacturing, etc. offline and on-site.

## 我们的使命

AOS的使命是提供一个面向教师和学生的开放获取、免费获取、计算机基础知识综述为主的电子期刊学术交流社区，从已有的资料、文献、存储在计算机和计算机网络中的所有类型的知识中构建知识点网络，促进各类学术知识和技能的“科学”的发展、教育和采用，具体推动每一个人在科技方面，尤其是计算机和数据处理方面的最近发展区。

## 我们的机构

AOS的机构由期刊编委会、编程开发社区、计算机操作组成。编程开发社区建立在github组织https://github.com/AcademicOpenSystem。计算机操作指的是线下的、现场的计算机上的讨论、设计、绘图、编程、制造等操作动手能力。


# 2.Journal of Data Reduction (JDS) column

Datafication belongs to the field of information technology and computer application, especially based on computer science and technology and its application, and also focuses on data processing flow and analysis application. The reader group focuses on scholars and popular science readers in related fields, the writing group focuses on graduate students and researchers in the field, the internal supervision groups are mainly editorial boards and author groups, and the external supervision groups are mainly in scientific and technological publishing houses, computer science societies and Industry Association. The currently planned journal columns mainly include: ① Computer Science Theory; ② Computer Engineering Technology; ③ Information Technology Datafication; ④ Software Engineering Informatization; There are six columns in total, with an average of five to ten papers in each column (about five in the academic trough and about ten in the peak). Other papers such as academic innovation are supplemented; the main research fields collected: EE (electronic engineering), CS (computing science), IT (information technology), DS (data science), AI (artificial intelligence) and other data or information collection, Processing, analysis, storage, etc.

## 数据简化期刊(JDS)栏目

数据化属于信息技术和计算机应用领域，尤其是基于计算机科学和技术及其应用，也关注数据处理流程和分析应用。读者群体重点在于相关领域的学者和科普读者，写作群体重点在于领域内的研究生和研究者，内部监督群体主要是编委会和作者群体，外部监管群体主要在科技类出版社、计算机领域学会和行业协会。目前规划的期刊栏目主要有：①计算机科学理论；②计算机工程技术；③信息技术数据化；④软件工程信息化；⑤计算领域人事物资；⑥期刊事务公示等。共六个栏目，每个栏目平均五至十篇论文(学术低谷时五篇左右、高峰时十篇左右)，以知识点和研究点的详细综述为主，工程技术设计开发、复现优化、学术创新等其他论文为辅；收集的主要研究领域：EE(电子工程)、CS(计算科学)、IT(信息技术)、DS(数据科学)、AI(人工智能)等数据或信息的采集、处理、分析、存储等方向。
